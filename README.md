# c_practice

Welcome to the c_practice repository. This project is a curated collection of standalone C programming solutions to a variety of problems, primarily focused on strengthening my foundational knowledge in C programming. Here, you will find solutions to 50 different problems that were carefully selected from various online sources to ensure a comprehensive coverage of basic to intermediate C programming concepts.

Please note that this repository only contains the solutions to the problems, and not the problems themselves. You might need to refer to the original problem sources to understand the context of each solution.

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple standalone C files, each named according to the problem it solves. Each C file represents a solution to a unique problem. There are no interdependencies among these files, and they can be run individually.
